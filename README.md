## Welcome
```
These projects are split into three groups:

- Dev Academy course work
- Online tutorial projects
- Personal projects
```

### Course Work 
_Currently a large portion of my GitHub is my coursework - Dev Academy introduced me to Git. Group projects have been cloned out of private group repos so will be missing the commits and development._


#### Solo Projects

[UFO Reporter](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/unit-standards) created to show I had an understanding of routing and could create, retrieve, update and delete data from a JSON file.

[Pre-Bootcamp first website](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/Kate-Hooker.github.io) created to gain access to the Dev Academy foundations course. First website I ever made. 

[Memory Card Game](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/memory-game-project) my first big React project - had CSS provided, created and followed instructions provided in the projects ReadMe to make the game work.


#### Group Projects

[News Reader](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/news-reader) a 24 hour agile group project, combined 2 APIs (one to find the main news articles being published in different parts of the world and summarise them, the other is a screen reader)  

[Forragers Map](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/Forragers-map) 24 hour agile project using a new tech stack and a map API to create an app that could benefit society in some way. Uses leaflet, knex, vanilla javascript and a database to allow users to share their favourite forraging spots. 

[Monsta-Hunterz Trading Cards](https://github.com/mako-2023/Monsta-Hunterz) 24 hour agile project - challenge was to create a fun piece of coded software incorporating multiple databases (a database of players, a database of all cards available in the game, and a database of all the cards registered to each players deck) used AI to design all the card details and art. 



### Tutorials
_I use web tutorials to learn new tech stacks and practise areas that I wanted to revisit after my course:_

This [Calculater](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/React-calculater) is my most recent tutorial project. I really wanted to practise debugging so I started this one thinking it would be very easy to follow the chain of events that makes the calculater work.




### Personal Projects 
_These are often about practising my course materials and slowly expanding on foundational learning:_

[Packing List](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/packing-list) is a deployed full stack project I did to practise building APIS and creating, retrieving, updating and deleting data.

[Blackjack](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/blackjack/tree/main) was the last project I did before I entered bootcamp. I taught myself java and learnt JS during my four week code foundatiom course. This was my first completely self-made project.
