## Hi there welcome to the lab! 
```
My projects split into three groups:

- Dev Academy course work
- Online tutorial projects
- Personal projects
```


### Tutorials
I do tutorials to learn new tech stacks and practise areas that I wanted to revisit after my course:

[Postit](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/postit) is my most recent tutorial project - I want to familiarise myself with Prisma because I like how it universally handles databases.



### Personal Projects 
These are often about practising my course materials and slowly expanding on foundational learning:

[Packing List](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/packing-list) is a deployed full stack project I did to practise building APIS and creating, retrieving, updating and deleting data.

[Blackjack](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/blackjack/tree/main) was the last project I did before I entered bootcamp. I taught myself java and learnt JS during my four week code foundatiom course. This was the first self made project I did.  


### Course Work 
Makes up most of my repos because Dev Academy was what introduced me to github.

#### Solo Projects

[UFO Reporter](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/unit-standards) created to show I had an understanding of routing and could create, retrieve, update and delete data from a JSON file

[Pre-Bootcamp first website](https://github.com/Kate-Hooker/Kate-Hooker.github.io) created to gain access to the Dev Academy foundations course. First website I ever made. 

#### Group Projects
